## Challenge: shuffle the tracks

--- challenge ---
A nice feature to have on an MP3 player is the option to shuffle the tracks so that they play in a random order.
Pushing the joystick down the Sense HAT means the same thing to Scratch as pushing <kbd>Enter</kbd> on the keyboard.
Can you change your MP3 player code so that when the joystick is pushed, the code chooses and plays a random track?
