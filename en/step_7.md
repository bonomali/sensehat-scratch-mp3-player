## Challenge: Shuffle the track

--- challenge ---
A nice feature to have on an MP3 player would be the ability to shuffle the tracks, so that they play in a random order.
Pushing the joystick into the SenseHAT is treated the same way as pushing `Enter` on the keyboard.
Can you change the MP3 player code so that when the joystick is pushed, it chooses and plays a random track?
