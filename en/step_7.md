## Challenge: shuffle the tracks

--- challenge ---
Can you make your MP3 player stop and start again when the joystick is pushed down?

A nice feature to have on an MP3 player is the option to shuffle the tracks so that they play in a random order.

The Sense HAT can detect changes in the air's humidity, which means you can trigger events by gently blowing on it.

Can you change your MP3 player code so that when you blow on the Sense HAT, it detects a change in humidity and then plays a random track?
