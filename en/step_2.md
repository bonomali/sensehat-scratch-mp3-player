## Making it sparkle

Let's being by getting the Sense HAT to show a random sparkly display to accompany your favorite music.

--- task ---
Open Scratch 2 from the application menu.
[[[rpi-scratch-opening]]]
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Choose a sprite for your MP3 player â€” here we're going to use a speaker.
![speaker](images/speaker.png)
[[[generic-scratch3-sprite-from-library]]]
--- /task ---

You can delete any scripts or sounds that are already on your sprite.

--- task ---
Add the **Pi SenseHAT** extension in Scratch.
[[[rpi-scratch3-add-sensehat-extension]]]
--- /task ---

Now you're all set up, you can begin to make your MP3 player by creating a disco effect on the display.

--- task ---
Begin by adding a `when flag clicked`{:class="blockevents"} block, and then add a `forever`{:class="blockcontrol"} block below it.
```blocks3
when flag clicked
forever
```
--- /task ---

Colours can be represented by what are called Hexadecimal codes or *hexcodes* for short. You can see a list of some hexcodes along with the colours they represent below.
